# hello-world
My first repository.
I am looking to get into coding, and this is pretty much the very beginning of it. I'm hoping to look back on this in 9 months and truly appreciate the steps that I have taken to become a better coder and potentially use that to push myself in my career.
*I added these changes at the request of the tutorial*
